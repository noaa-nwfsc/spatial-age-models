# spatial-age-models

9/24 meeting: 
Things to focus on for results: 
  - ecologically interesting plots
  - add more species or not? [not a huge priority]
  -   NT: Dover / thornyhead could be interesting thinking about bycatch (where could you get big fish but not bycatch)
  -     Does bycatch observed correlate with predictions for those years? 
  -   EW is talking to Dan / Kate about tying this to observer data 
  - Canada? [if data is too complicated, stick to west coast]. Canadians have very few hake samples, and almost no sablefish aged. Check with Sean A.

  - EW will think about residuals more and test datasets. 

Age 0 bycatch availability by certain ports?
Availability of larger sablefish by port?
  - how is this changign over time if at all?
